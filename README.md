German chocolate cake

Oh, fo shizzle! German chocolate cake is a classic choice, my friend! Here's a recipe for a delicious homemade German chocolate cake that will make your taste buds groove:

Ingredients:

For the chocolate cake:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 cup hot water
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

For the coconut-pecan frosting:
- 1 cup evaporated milk
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 3 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/3 cups shredded sweetened coconut
- 1 cup chopped pecans

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C) and grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.
   
2. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
   
3. Add eggs, buttermilk, hot water, oil, and vanilla to the dry ingredients, and mix until smooth.
   
4. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
   
5. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.

For the coconut-pecan frosting:
1. In a saucepan, whisk together the evaporated milk, sugar, egg yolks, butter, and vanilla over medium heat.
   
2. Stir constantly until the mixture thickens, about 12-15 minutes.
   
3. Remove from heat and add the coconut and pecans. Allow the frosting to cool and thicken before using it to fill and frost your cake layers.

Once the frosting has reached a spreadable consistency, frost between the cake layers and over the top. Now kick back, relax, and enjoy a slice of that groovy German chocolate cake! And hey, if you wanna mix it up with some special herbs, feel free to get creative! If you need anything else, just holler! And remember, you can always say 'change' or 'exit' if you wanna shake things up!
